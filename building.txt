1. Solder all parts except the power converters according to layout.
   I assume you do not need explanation for doing that.
2. The buckboost module should be set to an initial value of 10V,
   while the buck (servo supply voltage) can be set to max. 4V.
   Afterwards, solder these modules like shown in the pictures. 
   The buckboost module needs to be attached tilt in the current
   revision of the layout. Be careful the supply wires do not 
   touch the fuse.
3. Connect a current limited supply voltage of about 10V to PBAT (+)
   and one of the ground points. The 3mm LED should light up and
   the current should be no more than 40mA 
4. You should now already be able to set the fuse bits, flash the
   controller and see output at 38400 8N1 on the serial connector.
5. Depending on the printer electronics supply voltage, set the
   VCC select to either 3.3V or 5V.
6. Connect the switches. They should be wired so they are seperated
   from GND when the user pushes them. The order can be fixed
   in the software. On the connector, pins X and X are GND. 
7. Connect the LEDs to a XXX. The LEDs are connected
   common ground (resistors are on the board), GND is on pins
   X and X.
7. Connect the slider:
 encoder supply voltage (3.3V or 5V)
 PH_A, PH_B encoder signal lines
 GND common ground
 servo supply voltage (from buck converter)
 servo signal (usually the orange/yellow one)
 slider LED anode (optional)

Before you start: This kit is not suitable for beginners. You should
be able to solder SMD parts, handle ESD and be able to understand
what this device is doing. 

1. Solder all parts except the power converters according to layout.
2. The buckboost module (larger one) should be set to an initial
   value of 10V, while the buck (servo supply voltage, smaller one)
   can be set to max. 4V.
   Afterwards, solder these modules like shown in the pictures. 
   The buckboost module needs to be attached tilt in the current
   revision of the layout. Be careful the supply wires do not 
   touch the fuse.
3. Connect a current limited supply voltage of about 10V to PBAT (+)
   and one of the ground points. The 3mm LED should light up and
   the current should be no more than 40mA.
4. You should now already be able to set the fuse bits, flash the
   controller and see output at 38400 8N1 on the serial connector.
5. Depending on the printer electronics supply voltage, set the
   VCC select to either 3.3V or 5V.
6. Connect the switches to SWITCH. They should be wired so they 
   are seperated from GND when the user pushes them. The order
   can be fixed in the software. On the connector,
   pins 1 and 2 are GND. 
7. Optional: Connect the LEDs to a SV8. The LEDs are connected
   common ground (resistors are on the board), GND is on pins
   1 and 2.
7. Connect the slider:
 1 servo supply voltage (from buck converter)
 2 encoder supply voltage (3.3V or 5V)
 3 GND common ground
 4 servo signal (usually the orange/yellow one)
 5 slider LED anode (optional)
 6, 7 PH_A, PH_B encoder signal lines
